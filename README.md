. React native to build react mobile apps

.proton (react) to build desktop app.


.setState is used to update the state.
 
 in this app whenever newtodo change we want to 
 update it so thats why we are using setState.

 because of using setstate it arises binding issues.

 it will give an error saying this.setstate is undefined(it means (this keyword) is undefined )

 for solving this we have to use => arrow function
  to bind the eventListeners in the form such as 
  
  newTodoChanged and formSubmitted.

.showing the todos in the screen and clearing the input when we click the addTodo.

.adding All done and remove button to the screen
